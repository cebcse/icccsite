Feeling the winds of change the cavers of ICCC gathered to choose the lucky few who would lead them into the next year. Through several rousing speeches (mostly consisting of nominating someone else for the job), thrilling debates ("You do it" "I already did it, you do it"), and finally indisputably fair voting (nominating a coin toss as a candidate when you're losing is standard practice) the committee was chosen.
