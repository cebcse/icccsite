Another year, another excellent expedition to Slovenia. With 2.2 km discovered in Vrtnarija, all below 600 m, Pivo Moz 2015 was another successful year for ICCC. Significant work went into the pushing of the leads off Sic Semper Tyrannis which led to the closure of an 840m loop in the south, while Colarado Duck (formerly Sump) was passed with a further 270m found beyond, in the northern reaches of the cave. Aven climbing at Strap on the Nitro enabled the discovery of 294 m of south trending passage heading towards Wonderstuff in the ‘old system’.
