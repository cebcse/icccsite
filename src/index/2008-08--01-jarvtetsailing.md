While most people in the caving club did something sensible this summer, such as caving, or caravan'ing in Hull, Tetley &amp; Jarv decided to go for a jaunt around the Atlantic in a stupidly small 26 foot sailboat. And after having survived the crossings, fought with the dolphins &amp; endured each other's fine company in a telephone-box sized living space, what did they do at the paradise islands they visited?<br>Why, they went underground of course!
