Suddenly it's that time of the year again! Soon we leave our South Ken haunts and haul a minibus of caving gear across Europe to head to a pretty little mountain in Slovenia called Tolminski Migovec.  

We've some excellent leads and a keen team this year with a clear planâ€”we're immediately rerigging Vrtnarija (807m deep / 8776m long) to the bottom and setting up Camp X-Ray (-550m) as a hot-bunking 4-bed camp and pushing the multitude of leads from 500-800m deep. On the surface we will be launching trips down Kavkna Jama (M2) in search of the great, elusive, connection.  

During this time we are slaves to the Sistem, so it may seem all a little quiet around here. However, thanks to the wonders of mobile telephony, for the fourth year running, you can follow our every move on twitter [@ICCC](http://twitter.com/iccc).

**End of August Update: More than 2km of deep cave found! Photos, surveys, tweets and draft report: [Izgubljeni Raj 2011](/caving/old/slovenia/slov2011).**
