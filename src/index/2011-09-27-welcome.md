Welcome Team 2011!  
Come find our stand in Beit Quad during Freshers Fayre (11AM-4PM, Tuesday 4th October), and have a chat to one of our club members.  

We have an excellent Autumn calendar of trips organised, and plans are afoot for foreign trips during the various university holidays.  

Since you're here, check out some of our massive website. Thinking big, you may be interested in this Easter's trip to Sardinia ([Photos](/caving/photo_archive/tours/2011%20-%20sardinia/dirindex.html), [PDF Report](/caving/old/sardinia/caving_spring_tour_report_2011.pdf)), our exploration project in Slovenia ([2011 Updates](/caving/old/slovenia/slov2011/), [2010 Photos](/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/2010/), [Dec 2009 Winter Recce Photos](/caving/photo_archive/slovenia/2009-12-Recce/)). Closer to home, our weekend trip reports may give you a sense of what to expect: [typical non-rope freshers trip weekend](/caving/old/mendips/mendip-2011-01-21.php), [SRT Yorkshire Weekend](/caving/old/yorkshire/yorkshire-2010-10-29.php) and the [kind of harder trip](/caving/old/yorkshire/yorkshire-2010-03-19.php) we do [later in the year](/caving/old/yorkshire/yorkshire-2011-04-28.php), once all you new guys & girls are trained up.
