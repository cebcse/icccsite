Hello new cavers!

Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you're in the right place.

We are an active and friendly club. We have regular trips, meet ups and foreign expeditions (...holidays) and we hope you'll want to get involved.

A list of our upcoming trips can be found above, as well as on our [GCal](calender.php). There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members [here](new_member.php). You can also check out our trip reports in the menu to the left to find out more about our trips. [A typical Wales (fresher's) trip](/caving/old/wales/wales-2010-10-15.php). [A typical Yorkshire trip.](/caving/old/yorkshire/yorkshire-2012-11-09.php)

Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at fresher's fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. After that join us in **Princes Gardens each Wednesday at 1pm** where we will be doing an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) or at the **Union Bar on Tuesdays at 7pm** (starting 8/10/13) for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures.
