An... interesting weekend!<br>Most of the group got involved with a large Cave Rescue operation - a caver had abseiled off the end of a rope [never forget to tie stop knots!] + had to be stretchered out after falling 5m onto his shoulder. Luckily, his injuries were relatively minor all things considered + is ok.<br>Tasty late-night curry [rescue continued till about midnight, with the other cavers stranded in their furies in a pub in Castleton], Sunday trips were short but taxing; Tom, Steph + Dan went for a walk up a big hill followed by a perversely pleasant cream tea.Tasty late-night curry [rescue continued till about midnight, with the other cavers stranded in their furies in a pub in Castleton], Sunday trips were short but taxing; Tom, Steph + Dan went for a walk up a big hill followed by a perversely pleasant cream tea.
