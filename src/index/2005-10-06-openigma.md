Trip went with an absolute bang. Weather atrocious - Tolminski Migovec spent the entire time inside a cloud! One patch of good seeing, as the clouds briefly sunk below the 1490m altitude we were staying at, just in time for the nearly-full moon to rise behind the peak of Migovec (see photo on right). U-Bend was duly pushed, but the too-tight rift is still too-tight! Ropes have been left rigged for our winter return...
