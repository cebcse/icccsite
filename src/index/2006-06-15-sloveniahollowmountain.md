We've just finished the final draft for our 1994-2005 report on our summer expeditions to Western Slovenia. With One-Hundred and Ninety-Nine pages covering over a decade - its a story of nearly a man-century of effort by IC cavers and Slovenian cohorts overcoming challenges to find and explore caves deeper than the tallest buildings in the world.. <br><br>Join this club, learn a crack collection of skills during the weekend trips and then you too could be joining us in summer 2007 to explore these "caverns measureless to man".<br><br>This is the last edit before producing a bound-copy sometime in late 2006. And corrections, improvements, cartoons &amp; etc. gratefully received.
