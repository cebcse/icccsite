And so off to Migovec again!  
We start the expedition with Vrtnarija at 11025/888 m and the recently extended Sysmig at 11846 / 970 m. Searching for the elusive connection between the two systems (and thus forging the longest cave in Slovenia) and deep camping in Vrtnarija to continue the exploration of the 2010 and 2011 finds are the main aims of this 5 week expedition. However, there are many other projects on the side, and we will be tweeting updates from our mountaintop bivouac.
