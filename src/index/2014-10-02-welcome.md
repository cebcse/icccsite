Hello new IC students!

Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you've come to the right place.

We are an active and friendly club. We have regular weekend caving trips, mid-week meet ups in London, and foreign expeditions (...holidays). We hope you'll want to get involved.

A list of our upcoming trips can be found above, as well as on our [GCal](calender.php). There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members [here](new_member.php). You can also check out our trip reports in the menu to the left. [A typical Wales (fresher's) trip](/caving/old/wales/wales-2010-10-15.php); [A typical Yorkshire trip](/caving/old/yorkshire/yorkshire-2012-11-09.php). And please email us on our gmail if you have any questions.

Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at Fresher's Fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. After that join us in **Princes Gardens each Wednesday at 1pm** where we will be doing an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) or at the **Union Bar on Tuesdays at 7pm** (starting 8/10/13) for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures.

Also check out our new promo video made by James O'Hanlon:
