##Friday

**Dave Heroically Rescues Jack from Stafford**

####DKP

**Craven Pothole Club Hut Review**

Pros:
- Walking distance from cool caves
- Cool bunkroom
- Nice kitchen
- Good drying room

Cons:
- Small, uninspiring common room.
- Need a qualification in road safety to get to gear store
- Gear store in seperate building
- FASCISM

In conclusion, balls to craven.

### Little Hull Pot: {{ DATE=2018-02-03; CAVE=Little Hull Pot; }}

**Dave Stoically Faces Great Peril**

#### DKP

Amidst chaos and terror on Saturday morning I managed to steal away with the 3 finest cavers I could find. Or the first ones I found. With prepacked bags we skipped off towards Little Hull without a care for earthly things such as the code to get into the hut, or where Perry was going to put DKPs car keys, or why Perry had DKPs car keys.

The walk to Little Hull is fairly long but mostly gentle and along a nice track. After 40 minutes on this track you pass a gate and reach a 4 way crossroad and the way on is to go at a 45 degree angle from the left wall. Over the brow of a hill it is possible to see the shallow depression in which lies Little Hull, just a minutes further walk. The entrance is a small, dark slip into a crawl.

I led, with the first bag skipping and bouncing on the cobbles behind me. Dogged by Mr Jack I set a quick pace and we were very quickly at the head of the first pitch. I had some in-situ rope to follow which I imagined saved some time as it meant it was obvious to step into a window immediately on the first hang. A small traverse brought me to the final hang. At the bottom I waited for Ben, bringing up the rear and therefore of course having the second bag of rope. Ben volunteered to rig the next pitch.

A longish traverse leads to an easy squeeze and out onto a crows nest ledge looking out on the final hang, void on both sides. It was all the more nest like for the 50m of abandoned in situ rope haphazardly flaked on the floor. Very comfy. We settled in and Ben rigged. The hang is off two bolts quite a reach away on the far wall. I was second down and had to do a terrifying maneouver where I had to lean on my head on the far wall in order to free both my hands to rig my descender. Still it was done and done I went.

At the bottom we waited for a while before DKP appeared. And then a longer while until Mr Jack said he was not happy with passing the rigging. I sent Ben and DKP ahead to rig the final pitch and bounced (literally) up the rope. At the top I rerigged so that the previously tight traverse line was abseilable and got Jack's seal of approval. Back at the bottom we hurried to catch up with Ben and DKP. We opted for the duck rather than faff about with the tight squeeze bypass (it is entirely possible to keep your torso dry in the duck). 

We caught the other two as DKP was climbing a random rope into the cieling. I told him to come down. On close inspection that rope appears to be tied around a single rock and its not obvious what its for. We continued down the stream, squeezing, climbing and crawling until we reached a pitch. A single spit in the wall taunted us. We looked around for a while but failed to find any p bolts (apparently there's a chimney climb shortly after the fixed rope that leads to a traverse).

I started rigging on some naturals but as I finished wrapping a sling around a rock that was wedged in the streambed I thought better of it and decided we'd had enough fun for one day. The way out felt fairly quick. Ben derigged the bottom pitch and Jack the top. We sang the new song I learned 'Rattling Bog' for a bit. Exiting into daylight was a rare pleasure and we followed out footprints home.


## Sunday

### Alex's Shit Dig: {{ DATE=2018-02-04; CAVE=Alex's Shit Dig; }}

**Dave Gallantly Attends Surface Reconnaissance**

D.O.G.G.E.R.S Bulletin No. 1

Introduction:
This is the first of hopefully many publications from the Diligent Officers of Grim and Grimey Exploratory Reconnaissance and Surveying. In our reports we hope to expose a large audience to our thorough explorations of the more obscure crevices that the underworld has to offer. 

Members present:
Alex Seaton (Chairman)
Rhys Tyers (Vice Chairman)
Rebecca Diss (Surface Worker)
David Kirkpatrick (Logistics Officer)

Target: 
REDACTED

Summary of exploration:
The illustrious chairman had uncovered reports of a location that had not been pushed to it's fullest potential. A thorough search of online material revealed that the latest known explorations had halted at the last of three sumps/ducks but that there was a further potential for 2km of horizontal and 60m vertical development. With the hope that perhaps the water could be persuaded to lower, or that some alternative route be found, our chairman organised this first trip.

Our main aims were to locate the cave and further the route to the main drag within. Upon our arrival at REDACTED Tubs we found a steep beautiful snow covered valley. Streams sprung from several holes in the side. We changed by the side of the Butter REDACTED. Our surface team helped Alex and myself into our suits, and apparatus. Once suitably clothed we followed rabbit tracks down the steep slope to the bottom of the valley. 

The site of our cave was fairly obvious. A large limestone outcrop with a stream resurging below. We examined the limestone face for entrances and found a couple. Alex picked one and we began our descent. A loose and obviously dug climb down leads immediately to a small collapsed chamber. A flat out crawl across the top of a large boulder led via a climb down into the streamway. 

We explored quite a few ways on. The immediate dry ways on die. Following the largest stream upstream there is a stoop under some shelves. Beyond, following the water finds a sump and above the sump a passage leads to horrific gloopy mud crawls that threatens to stick us permanently in place.

The correct way on is a climb on the left (looking upstream) just after the shelves. A tight hands and knees crawl in mud leads past a small drippy aven and then drops into a large collapse chamber, with the stream running at the bottom. Climbing down to the left it is possible to go left and right. Left leads into a walking passage that almost immediately sumps. Right, squeezing past a boulder, goes into walking passage. We followed the obvious passage and climbed over some pools into a crawl. The crawl led quickly to the streamway again.

The cave is marvellous beyond this point. The streamway quickly opens out to walking size and goes for some way. One section has huge teeth of rock jutting straight down into the passage but it is possible to zig zag around them and avoid the need even to stoop for the most part. The streambed is covered with a deep silt that makes walking tricky and in many places there is evidence of flooding to the roof. Once or twice there are large blocks, fallen from the cieling, that must be scrambled over or squeezed past. After a while the passage closes down and there is a junction. To the right the passage lowers to a grim looking duck. To the left the passage lowers and you pass the other side of the grim looking duck. Continuing the passage lowers to a crawl. There is a small dry flat out crawl on the left.

Wiggling through this brought us to a chamber of impressive dimensions, with a small cascade over fallen rocks and boulders in the middle. Continuing upstream we are rewarded with more fine streamway. All too soon this lowers and the stream disappears under a floor of rocks and pebbles. We find a chamber formed of fallen blocks from the cieling that have often left almost perfectly shaped sockets in the cieling. The cracks running across the dark rock warn of the next cieling block to fall.

A flat out crawl continues. It would be hands and knees if not for our reluctance to scrape the ceiling. Too long after we rejoing the stream. Stooping passage brings us to the first of three ducks. We (mostly I) decide this is our turn around point for today. Alex decides to examine the duck more closely first though and wades in. He emerges manic and eager to continue moving.

We make our way out. There is perhaps only 40 minutes of mostly pleasant caving to the exit from this first duck. We emerge to daylight. I attempt to clean my oversuit on the snow, with some success. Our surface team welcomes us back.

Next steps:
Return, and pass the ducks. Neoprene highly recommended.
