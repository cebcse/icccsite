Title: Wales (PhD)
Date: 2008-10-03
Location: wales
Summary: Quickly quickly before all the undergraduates arrived, we shot off for a little weekend trip with the JN/EXSS group of the physics department to enjoy the pleasure of Top Entrance (OFD) and the perverse delights of evening games in the WSG hut. Major washout on the Saturday which prevented us from venturing to the streamway, rain had stopped by Sunday lunch in time for a beautiful walk up a hill in the Brecons.
