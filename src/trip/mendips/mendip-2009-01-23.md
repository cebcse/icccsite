Title: Mendips II
Date: 2009-01-23
Location: mendips
Summary: Nice to be back to the Belfry, this time with fewer unbooked university clubs turning up to vomit on our clothing and snuggle up to us at night! The more worked in set off on a Swildons Short-Round with the fine direction of El Tet, a bounce to the sump and a GB investigation (up the comedy climb - only took one spreader with them - oops!). Sunday saw a St Cuths trip courtesy of Mad Phil, before a Megabus return to London.
