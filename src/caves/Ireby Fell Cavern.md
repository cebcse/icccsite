Park at the water works at the end of Masongill Fell Lane. Walk up the Turbary Road until a paved path leads off over a stile to the left. Follow the path across the field and up the hill. Cross into the next field at the stile. Follow the path on the other side which leads to Ireby, just before the next wall.
