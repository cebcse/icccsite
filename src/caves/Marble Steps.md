Park at the water works at the end of Masongill Fell Lane. Walk up the Turbary Road until a paved path leads off over a stile to the left. Follow the path across the field. Half way along a path leads off to the right past some large shakeholes towards a copse of trees. Marble Steps is in amongst the trees.
