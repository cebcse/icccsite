Title: Slovenia Winter Recce
Date: 2009-12-29
Location: andalucia
Summary:  The trip started, as all good things do, with a 5AM alpine start; we caught the first train out of Most Na Soci and through the Julian alps to Bohinjska Bistrica, then a bus to Hotel Zlatorog near Savica (the possible Black Sea resurgance for the Migovec systems). With ice axe and crampons a quick 1.2km of ascent saw us up on our beloved plateau, with Tolminski Kuk brooding in the cloud layer. Based at Dom na Komni, we spent the next day in poor viz logging 5 new blow holes and having a look at the N1-3 entrances.
