Park 350m beyond the road to Braida Garth farm. Walk a further 300m up the road and enter the field on the left through a sheep pen. Stick to the left wall and walk up the hill. At the top go through a second sheep pen and turn right onto the green lane. Walk for ~300m. Jingling is a large open shaft with an overhanging tree just over the rise on the left.
