###Location

{{ map }}

Park as you would for Lost John's and walk into the Lost John's enclosure. At the back right (coming from the road) there is a stile which you should cross. A vague path leads up the fell. Very quickly (< 5 minutes) you should see the large fenced enclosure of Lost Pot. Skirting round it to the right, the first large shake hole you see will be It's A Cracker. The entrance is a concrete tube.
