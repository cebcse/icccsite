Park in second lay by beyond the entrance to Braida Garth Farm. Walk directly up the field on the Western side of the road. When you reach the Turbary Road, continue climbing up over the small rise. At this point the tree for Jingling should be visible. Walk towards it. Aquamole is an obvious man made entrance between Jingling and the Turbary Road.
