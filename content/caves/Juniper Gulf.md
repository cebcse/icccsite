###Location

{{ map }}

There are a couple of ways to walk up. The easiest is to park in Horton in Ribblesdale and follow the well marked path, starting at the train station, heading west towards Ingleborough. Then after about an hour of walking turn left and walk into a big field to find Juniper Gulf somewhere in the middle. TAKE A GPS.

The entrance is a shaft with a stream sinking in it.
