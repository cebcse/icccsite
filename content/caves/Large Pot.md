###Location

{{ map }}

Park at the water treatment station by Masongill. This is essentially the end of the tarmac on the road that goes onto the fell through Masongill. Continue walking straight up the the Turbary Lane and after 10 minutes you will enter a new field. Shortly after the lane turns 90 degrees to the right. Do not turn right. Instead keep walking straight up the field with the wall on your left. Eventually a fenced off shakehole will be visible at the end of the field. This is Small Pot (?). In a smaller shakehole directly adjacent to the fence is the entrance to Large Pot. It is covered by a metal plate.


###Cave

The second pitch of Large has a very tight, very awkward pitch head. It would be unwise for anyone not proficient at SRT to attempt it.

There is also an extended muddy stoop/crawl section before the final pitch that would challenge the less fit.
