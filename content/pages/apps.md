## CaveView

[CaveView](/rcc/caving/apps/CaveView) is a in browser viewer for 3d cave survey data. We have this instance showing the latest System Migovec survey data. This is the cave that ICCC explores every year in Slovenia with the JSPDT.

## Rain Gauge

[Rain Gauge](/rcc/caving/apps/rain) is an interface for the Environment Agency's [real time data api](http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference). It allows you to view current and historical data from automated rain gauges across England. The source is available at [https://github.com/rhyst/rain-gauge](https://github.com/rhyst/rain-gauge).


## Report Editor

The [Report Editor](rcc/caving/apps/rain) allows people to edit this website. The source files are on Github and the Editor app interfaces with the Github API to provide an online trip report editor.

## Photo Processor

The [Photo Processor](/rcc/caving/apps/photos/) allows people to run the scripts that generate our photo gallery from a web page.

## Counters

We currently have two counters. We have the [Slovenia Countdown](/rcc/caving/apps/slov/) which counts down the days until we are returned to our true lives, exploring the caves of Migovec. The [Rescue Countup](/rcc/caving/apps/rescue/) counts the days since we last had to call a cave rescue service on a club trip or expedition.
