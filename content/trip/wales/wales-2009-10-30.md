Title: Wales II
Date: 2009-10-30
Location: wales
Summary: A wet weekend on the Llangattock escarpment! There were issues with capturing an Aggy key, so the Saturday was spent in the double whammy of Eglwys Faen (AKA Grafitti cave, or at least it should be...) and the short but sweet Ogof Pen Eryr. An inch of rain fell during Saturday night, so the path & caves were rather aquatic on the Sunday. Had a little explore down Aggy, but failed to find our way through the first choke.
