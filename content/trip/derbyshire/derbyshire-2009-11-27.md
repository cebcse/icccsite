Title: Derbyshire I
Date: 2009-11-27
Location: derbyshire
Summary: Derbyshire! And naturally, it was rather chilly. As we approached Castleton we could see the snow up on the peaks. Winnats pass was open, and we abandoned the bus on the sodden verge as there were dozen cars festooning the road. We assumed it meant millions of maillons down the entrance pitch - but was actually just one exchange trip, with each person in a separate car! Storming trip down and out, shot home to the Orpheus as the snow closed in to the roaring coal fires and a truly stuffing curry. Sunday saw us investigate the legends of Derbyshire caves worth doing which were not in Castleton...
