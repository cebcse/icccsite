Title: Yorkshire IV
Date: 2011-03-04
Location: yorkshire
Summary: Bullpot farm for the traditional early March Easegill fest. People disappeared in and out of various entrances including Top, Lancs, Cow, Link, WR and County. A massive curry was prepared with the new swish BPC kitchen facilities and eaten at the new long table. Caving games, debauchery & finally a slumbering return to London.
