### Juniper Gulf: {{ DATE=2017-09-16; CAVE=Juniper Gulf; }}

Up early, we surprised York and the sole NPC member at Greenclose by leaving by 10 am, rope bags all packed ready for an epic trip. Juniper Gulf! Supposedly one of the five best trips in the UK! The club hadn't done it in ages, and we had no trip reports, but a post on UK Caving peaked my interest and I laminated a few rigging guides and convinced everyone that walking 4.5 km to a cave was fine, just fine.

We arrived in Horton in Ribblesdale to find a huge number of hikers had also decided to park here. Even the car parks were full. Eventually we found a field where a farmer took £3 from us and then chatted for a while about a murder victim found stashed in Sell Gill a decade ago. Eventually I removed all my clothing and he got the message and left to let me get changed.

The walk up was long but pleasant, a gradual slope upwards on the massive dual carriageway that is the route up Ingleborough. We passed plenty of curious walkers, chatted to a few and eventually made it to a nice limestone pavement which contains Nick Pot. After this, we reached a dry stone wall, went through a gate and turned left, keeping the dry stone wall on our left as we crossed the boggy ground with a GPS to help locate the entrance.

The entrance is in a large shake hole, with the pitch at the far end from the streamway. The others sunbathed as I rigged a ridiculous y-hang which dropped down to some free climbable cascades. Diss followed with the second rope bag, and after a short, unprotected traverse we reached a long traverse I could actually rig. The bolts are well spaced to keep the epic feel of the cave, and there are several acrobatic moves required to reach the next bolt. I was glad to be tall and flexible, and I anxiously checked behind me to see if the others were able to use my rigging. I shouldn't have worried - four weeks in Slov had honed Diss like a diamond whetstone, and she had no trouble following me.

Down a short pitch we regained the streamway, and I took the second bag from Diss. I told her to wet the third bag ready for the long final hang, but I had forgotten this was 90 m of rope. The next section was a long unprotected crawl traverse over a 20 m drop. I found it taxing and unpleasant, and I can only imagine how much worse it was for Diss with 90 m of wet rope. But we made it through, and at a seemingly arbitrary point bolts began to appear and I rigged the Bad Step. This was not as bad as the description makes it seem, though some of the traverses I rigged by free climbing down one side of the drop and up the other. I then rigged this as a tight traverse that apparently made a fine zipline.

The Bad Step rift narrows and turns a sharp corner, presenting a tight pitch head which opens into what I think is the finest pitch in Juniper Gulf - well sculpted, and the waterfall emerges half way down through a gap in the bedding plane. At the bottom was more traversing, close to the water and increasingly drippy. I missed a few naturals, but the rigging was sound and soon I was above the huge void that contained the final pitch.

The rigging guide is somewhat unhelpful here, suggesting bolts that don't exist and bearing on a hazy resemblance to the actual location of the y-hang bolts for the long hang. And so it was that I found myself standing on a small pillar over a long drop, with a metre of slack on the rope above my hard locked descender. I clung to the rock in front of me, rigging my jammers one handed as the others all watched the the vacant curiosity of sheep, unaware of my peril.

Soon I was back up to the traverse line, rerigging two bolts as a y-hang and then down to a rebelay bolt five metres below. Yes, the 50 m hang is all off a single bolt - why there weren't two is beyond me. Primadonna is better rigged! The descent was glorious, a beautiful fluted shaft of black rock, the waterfall thundering next to you and your light unable to pick out the cave above or below.

At the bottom I was lashed with spray and a strong draft, and proceeded to put on all my extra layers as the others descended. I failed to find the flake to rebelay off to visit the sump, though the others eventually found something three metres up one wall that they used. Conscious of how cold I'd gotten waiting around, I was keen to be off, and went up the pitch after negotiating the derig with the others. I was barely warm at the top, a commentary either on my efficient prussiking or how cold I'd gotten.

Getting out of the cave was easy with Diss right behind me, and we relaxed n the sun on surface. Soon Ben and Mr Jack joined us, and we headed down the hill to the bus. We passed many, many walkers, all tired and worried and slightly panicked to see people in yellow suits jogging passed them. At the minibus we listened to belle and Sebastian and admired the sunset as the others came down the hill. Back to Greenclose for shakshuka and some whisky - a solid day. Not maybe one of my top five caves in the UK, but still very impressive and worth doing if the forecast is fair.

## Sunday

### Jingling Pot: {{DATE=2017-09-17; CAVE=Jingling Pot}}

Rigging practice was the order of Sunday. I was meant to go to Aquamole with Diss, but we found it occupied and decided to join Rhys, Mr Jack and James in Jingling next door. I waited on the surface in the sun until I got bored of the pleasant weather and dropped down to rig the long hang down. It's an awkward one - rig it as a y-hang and the rope rubs, so I setteld for an ultra tight traverse line and a fig 8, which sort of worked. At the bottom, I lay on the rocks looking up as the sun illuminated the sides of the shaft. It's a really lovely cave, and I can see how some people enjoy coming back to it over and over again.

James, Rhys and Mr Jack arrived and Diss rigged the pointless final pitch. Satisfied the dig still didn't go, we retreated up, Diss de-rigging competently. Soon we were out, to find James had gone to push a nearby streamway cave (turned out to be Jingling Cave). We decided to leave him there, but he emerged in time and we walked down the hill together.
