## Saturday

### Wretched Lanc (Lanc -> Wretched): {{ DATE=2017-11-11; CAVE=Lancaster Hole > Wretched Rabbit; }}

I had not planned my route for this trip. Instead I waited as the trips formed over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning, seeing who could offer me the most interest, or express the greatest need of my many talents.

So it was that I ended up in Peter's team on a classic trip from Lanc to Wretched Rabbit. We were assigned our charges for the day, and I was pleased to see Yan Jin and Mr Jack in our list in the little red book.

We drove up, following Tom's van, on the winding lane towards Bull Pot. On the edge of signal, Mr Jack got a phone call. DW claimed that we'd left a bag behind. A quick conversation and a call to the van ahead established it was Jack and Perry's. I failed however to establish who would go back to get it. Perry reversed the minibus down the lane to a passing point until it became obvious that Tom's van wasn't coming back. We went to get the bag.

Eventually at Bull Pot, we changed. I had a cunning plan to have Diss leave me a beer at Wretched Rabbit so I arranged that. Our team was ready quickly and we set off on the short walk to Lanc, almost immediately followed by a another pair of cavers. They overtook us on the last field and they joined a party of cavers already about to descend Lanc. Alex and his group joined us then, planning a bounce and a visit to more esoteric areas. We waited for the strangers to go down, and then Peter rigged down.

We gathered at the bottom of Lanc, our casios just sounding 2pm. I was a bit concerned that we wouldnt make it all the way to Wretched and out within our 8pm 'back to the van' call out. An echoey conversation with Alex hopefully instructed him not to derig on us, just in case we turned back. More echoes set up a complicated krab clipping system to establish who was out. Given our tight callout I set our team the challenge. 

If we reached the Minarets by 2pm we could continue, if not we would have to turn back. We began. Peter in front, armed with our laminated knowledge. We made good progess all the way to Stake Pot, Peter setting a quick pace. Stake Pot is the big up/down pit with fixed ropes. We negotiated this and on the other side Peter made the obscure right turn that the description told him to. After some narrow passage and crawling we stopped. Peter was unsure where the description was leading him, and I had no memory of small passage on this route. Some careful thinking established that we were now following the route towards Pippikin! Which is what the description is actually for. It's a bit tricky having to follow certain sections, some of them backwards. 

We backtracked and popped back out in the big main passage again and stomped off. Gosh there's a lot of it. I always forget this. We stopped I think twice, for less than a minute a time to regroup. Mr Jack had a wild look in his eyes and was drenched in sweat. Yan Jin was sweating for what she claimed was the first time in a cave. We would occasionally reach some landmark and feel bouyed, the Minarets were only a few sentences of description away! Then we would take precious minutes traversing some vast passage, barely touched on in the description and our hearts would sink. The closer we got the worse it would be to turn back.

The final section before the minarets is Bridge Chamber, followed by a chamber with a half arch of rock stacked up against a low bit of ceiling. Seeing these I madly rushed up the pile of rocks, hoping to catch sight of the low entrance to the Minarets. I got there, panting a little, sweating a lot and glanced at my watch. 2.04pm. Fuck it. Good enough. We had a rest, drank some water, ate some chocolate and continued.

It turned out I had found someone's shit dig rather than the Minarets, but it did not take us long to find the real Minarets. Everyone was suitably awed by the shape. I even felt confident enough in the time to take a few photos. Peter led us confidently on. It is then another long way before you reach Stop Pot and the fixed iron ladder. Again, much more than I remember or will ever remember. Though the description is good the bit just before Stop is different enough to the rest of the main passage to make you worry a little bit that youn have gone the wrong way, into a narrow climbey section. But the ladder is reassuring. At the bottom I took some more photos. 

Time was ticking on so Peter allowed me to lead through Wretched Rabbit. Twisting and turning, again much more passage than I remember (though I remembered the important bits!). Took some photos at the phalactite. Finally the big ropes indicated we were most of the way out. We were greeted by darkness and unfortunately a lack of beer. As we made our way back across the fields I imagined all the situations in which other cavers could have taken it. No one was above suspicion. Back at the van it was revealed that Diss and Jarv had picked it back up again on their way past from Top.

I nipped back across to derig Lanc, meeting a freezing Alex at the entrance. We instructed Davey to derig and I waited for their group to emerge and walked back with them. A brief interlude whilst we 'lost' the minibus keys and we were soon back at the NPC. It seemed like everyone had had a pretty good day! I was certainly satisfied with our trip.

## Sunday

### Lost Johns': {{ DATE=2017-11-12; CAVE=Lost Johns' Cave; }}

A surprising choice for a Sunday but it got no complaints by anyone before, and not by anyone on the trip after! I ended up rigging down Dome, with Yan Jin, Rita, Gus, DW, and Diss. I did not pack our ropes and realised once everyone had changed and the other groups gone that we did not have the rope for first pitche of Dome! DW came to the rescue, offering to drive back and get another rope, whilst I used one of our bottom ropes to rig the first pitch. He would then swap them out on his way down.

I realised at the bottom of the first pitch that we also did not have the rope for the second pitch! Luckily this one can be free climbed (it's not even that dodgy, I suspect its mostly roped for tired people) and a sling 'for protection' made it fairly pleasant. Thankfully I did have the rest of the ropes we needed and eventually met Alex and co. at Dome Junction. We negotiated for a while eventually deciding that my entire group would head out Centipede and derig and Alex and his group would do something else.

Everyone was pretty quick up Centipede. Diss derigged and didn't die. First group out and we got to see the sunset! Lovely trip, would do a Sunday Lost Johns' trip (despite it delaying our departure from Yorkshire).
