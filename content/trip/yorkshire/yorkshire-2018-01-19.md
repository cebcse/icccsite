## Saturday

##Large Pot: Tanguy, Alex, David Wilson (the younger), Jarv

"A man who is not afraid of [Large pot] will soon be [stuck], he said, for he will be going [in] on a day he shouldn't. But we do be afraid of [Large pot], and we do only be [stucked] now and again." ~ with apologies to John Millington Synge 

I was very keen for King. At stores on Tuesday, it soon became apparent that this was a minority plan, as everyone else was sick to their teeth of Kingsdale in general, and King in particular. Tanguy's planned visit to Large sounded like the nearest bestest thing. 

With Large, I've had a difficult relationship. It was one of the first Grade IV trips I led, coming in the Rift end on an exchange. Some 10 hours later, Sandeep and I tumbled out of the entrance and rolled down the hill. Saturated with grey mud, we were so wild-eyed at having followed a poor route description backwards (in a maze of twisty tight passages), that the exuberance of finding the 2nd pitch ropes powered our derig through the tight pitch head. Not wearing gloves, once I washed the mud off, I found a million tiny cuts on my hands, and spent the next week looking rather hagged. Several years later, outrageously more qualified (to the point where I should have really known better), I managed to get myself suspended upside at the head of the 2nd pitch, with my cows-tails between my ankles. By the time Thara had caught up with my and sliced the offending cows-tail, the capillaries had burst in my face. Again, I looked for a week like I'd had a much harder life than I've enjoyed.

The weather was still and stable, we changed by the pumping station and then walked up the hill. Large pot is a high entrance, and the last hundred metres was with proper (if slushy) snow. The clag had come down, but with the white carpet, there was still plenty of light bouncing around. 

Tanguy set off to rig, and we followed down. There's not much to back-up the entrance pitch to, but there are a couple of nice closely spaced (one hidden) P-bolts from which to have a proper y-hang. We shuffled down to the 2nd pitch. Tanguy rigged, Alex followed, and then David got repeatedly stuck on his way to the pitch head. 
From the first pitch there is a feet-first shuffle into a little chamber, and then a meandering rift that leads to the pitch head. The first part I find quite difficult, as it is sinuous and my long-legs get stuck trying to 'dog leg'. There is then a mini widening where the P-bolts start, and then after about 2m, the pitch hang. This requires a descender (preferably not a Stop!) rigging while lying down, and then a shuffle + holding yourself as far 'away' as possible to descend. 

David taking his time was very convenient. I was not having much a fun time with the squeeze on the way to the start of the rope! It had probably been a full year since I was last in a tight cave (Slovenia is never tight; and the Autumn trips were all fresher enough friendly). I tried the squeeze, felt my legs get wedged, and then realised that I was pinned in by my shoulder and arm. I backed out, sat in the little chamber thinking happy thoughts, and then gave it another go. Certainly the issue was mainly psychological (it did not help that I had been reliving my suspension many years earlier, in telling everyone about it), but also that lack of core-body strength required to shuffle yourself sideways through a squeeze. After a few insertions - escapes - calms - re-insertions, I had popped through to the traverse, and comparatively speaking, found the abseil easy. In Large pot, one of the reasons the strenuous passage between the 2nd and Colossus is so enjoyable, is that it means you don't need to think about passing the 2nd pitch for a few hours!

The trip was now very enjoyable. We kept close together, and squished and squeezed our way through the vadose chunks of rift and phreatic crawl-ways on top. Nothing is ever that tight, but almost all involves you physically being in contact with the rock. It also gets muddier and muddier. Soon you encounter puddles, which look shallow, but are actually a skim of water on top of 40 cm of chocolate mousse consistency mud! By the head of Colossus, the passage is very fine. The moon-milk has deposited itself to form a miniature dam. We refilled our water Nalgene here. 

Colossus itself is a fine pitch, effectively a L-hang (vaguely made into a asymmetric y-hang). There are still a load of random traverse lines in-situ, if you want to do the trip with minimalism. The trickle of water going down the pitch hits a ledge and ricochets exactly where the rope hangs. As a result it is always damp, and today there was a particularly hard rain falling. However, I don't think it is very dangerous - as long as you are psychologically OK with climbing through water. 

Pausing in the main chamber, we ate our bagels (delicious), the meat eaters carved into Tanguy's pork pie, and we sipped our flask of hot Ribena. Delightful! Perhaps perverse to bring an additional tackle sack of delights to a small cave, but it really made the trip more enjoyable, and everyone can do with more tackle-sack carrying practice!

We then set off to investigate the Mousehole bypass. All admired the Necropolis, and then we got stuck into the boulder choke. The bypass is really quite easy to find, spot the fat ropes in the chamber back (+ up) from the final bedding-plane squeeze to the Mousehole. An easy climb up the fixed rope lead to a crawlway with a small stream that got lower and wetter looking. No particular motivation to get wet, we desisted and went to look at the Mousehole. Tanguy squeezed through - just - with his SRT kit. I gave up after getting my croll stuck. Alex I think completed, but without SRT gear. David got stuck, and then went back to look around instead. 

Our high speed exit plan was smoothly executed, Alex and I taking the comf + spare metalwork out to the base of the 2nd pitch, Tanguy and David derigging Colossus behind. They were with us barely 15 minutes after we arrived. 

Combined tactics were then used to get the tackle sacks out the cave, Alex clipping one to the pitch bolt, me following up with another and then manhandling them both onto the traverse line while swinging around below. There is not much space to do this at all - and I was very glad for my Pantin. You're so busy there's no time to be claustrophobic! 

Up on the surface, there were clear skies and a deep freeze. While Tanguy derigged I star-gazed; the Earth-glow disc of the crescent moon was well visible against the black, the Milky Way wheeled overhead, and I spotted one satellite. Crunching down from the fell, soon spotted the minibus with signs of activity - perfect timing! We had gone underground at 11, and were out at 18:30.

Ensconced in Green Close, a very pleasant evening of eating (Pea Soup; followed by Brown-rice and sweet-potato and cabbage stew), and chatting to the many small groups of cavers visiting the hut was had. It was very nice to chat to a mix of people - these days it is unfortunately quite rare, and we somehow find ourselves mostly alone at the huts!

The next day we were petrified of the snow forecast. Deciding that we didn't really want to get snowed into a valley from which we couldn't escape; we made no caving plans. Walking plans collapsed once people realised quite how unpleasant it was to walk in the blown snow outside! We finished off our left-overs for an early lunch, and then departed early for London.
