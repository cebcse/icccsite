Two Ryanair tickets, one hold bag, one Fiat 500 car hire & a mission. What could possibly go wrong?  

For once, not much actually. Apart from a self-imposed starvation diet, 273m of survey was brought back, adding an extra hundred to the known depth of M2 and bringing the closest approach with Vrtnarija to within 4m (nb: 1.4km loop, estimated ~30m error), along an easy mud-floored dig taking a huge draught.
