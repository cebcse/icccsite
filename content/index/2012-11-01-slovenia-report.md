 Gathering together all the various results of our summer expedition is taking a long timeâ€”the complexity of the total, now connected, system is requiring a lot of effort to produce a survey on the same projection. We have thousands of photos to edit & select from, hundreds of expedition reports & stories to gather. However, motivated by some immoveable deadlines, we have managed to get together a provisional written report (as submitted to our Union as our summer tour report), and produced a provisional Extended-Elevation survey (with Slovene labels, for submission to the Jamar magazine).

We'll continue working on our surveys, extending & editing our expedition report, and try and get some of the many photos uploaded here.
