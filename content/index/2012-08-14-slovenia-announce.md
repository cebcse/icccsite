Our 18 year Odyssey in the Hollow Mountain (Tolminski Migovec) has reached a notable milestone with the connection of Vrtnarija to System Migovec, making it the longest cave in Slovenia!  

It's difficult to put into words how much this means to the people who have spent years (even decades!) dedicating their free time to this exploration project. Clewin (first expedition 1997) put it beautifully: "Everybody has a made a contribution, from surveying hundreds of meters of horizontal passages to pushing ridiculously tight rifts or squalid muddy dead ends to feeding hungry cavers in the bivvy."
