Hello 2015 freshers! Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you've come to the right place.

We are an active and friendly club. We have regular weekend caving trips, mid-week meet ups in London, and foreign expeditions (...holidays). We hope you'll want to get involved.

A list of our upcoming trips can be found above. There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members [here](/rcc/caving/pages/clubinfo.html). You can also check out our trip reports in the menu to the left. A [typical Wales (fresher's) trip](/rcc/caving/articles/wales-2013-10-25.html) and [A typical Yorkshire trip](/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2014-11-28.html).

You can email us on our [gmail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01pKgPf4L76j23E4ymTAu8fw==&c=CoX_UvK7tWMqLjrzhcaEXTCP8fRKKSw-Cl1eAzdIcj4=) if you have any questions. Or you can join our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/578983745563159/) to get the latest info on trips and socials.

Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at Fresher's Fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. After that join us in Princes Gardens each Wednesday at 12pm where we will be doing an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) or at the Union Bar, every Tuesdays from 7pm for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures - look for a caving helmet to find us!
