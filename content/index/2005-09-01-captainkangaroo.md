Linktext: Pushing Captain Kangaroo

For those that missed out on the true joy of exploring Captain Kangaroo deep within mountain Migovec this summer; Richard Venn has recorded his pushin' song, set to the tune of <a href="http://www.statlerbrothers.com/music/stlrsongs.html">Flowers on the wall</a> by the mighty <a href="http://www.statlerbrothers.com/">Statler Brothers</a>. You may have come across it on the Pulp Fiction soundtrack, or on the Underground Camp 2004 mix-tapes...<br>
