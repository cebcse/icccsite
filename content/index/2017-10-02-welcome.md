Hello 2017 freshers! Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you've come to the right place!
We are an active and friendly club. We have regular weekend caving trips, mid-week meet ups in London, and foreign expeditions (...holidays). We hope you'll want to get involved.

A list of our upcoming trips can be found above. There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members [here](/rcc/caving/pages/clubinfo.html) like trip reports: a [typical Wales (fresher's) trip](/rcc/caving/articles/wales-2013-10-25.html) and a [typical Yorkshire trip](/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2014-11-28.html).

You can email us on our [gmail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01pKgPf4L76j23E4ymTAu8fw==&c=CoX_UvK7tWMqLjrzhcaEXTCP8fRKKSw-Cl1eAzdIcj4=) if you have any questions, or you can join our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/578983745563159/) to get the latest info on trips and socials.

Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at Fresher's Fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. On Wednesday 4th October we have a welcome talk, followed by a talk on our [cave exploration expedition]( https://www.facebook.com/events/310046019470941/) at 12pm in Union Meeting Room 1 (all welcome), followed by an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) in Princes Gardens at 1 pm (and every Wednesday at 12pm thereafter). Also find us at the Union Bar, every Tuesdays from 6pm for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures - look for a caving helmet to find us!

Here's a video from an ancient president, describing the caving club. Some say he is still caving to this day..
