A brief interruption to drudgery of Easter revision, with a day-trip to some subterranean WWII fortifications in Kent. Amazing preservation &amp; complexity, these catacombs stretched from the eroding cliff face, to blocked-off stone staircases that would appear to end up just below the wine-cellars of some rather well-to-do houses. Cream tea enjoyed on the cliff-top, fossils hunted on the flint beach, and a rather pleasant time had by all. A few photos, more to come.
