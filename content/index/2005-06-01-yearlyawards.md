We were too busy caving to vote on the awards during the AGM, so the day-of-voting has been postponed to our LAST EVER SOUTHSIDE SESSION - JUNE 22ND! The race is still open, last minute moments of appaling behaviour could capture you one of these lovely prizes...

<b>The "For Evans Sake's" Award [Most creative use of bodily fluid]</b>: Currently <a href="/caving/photo_archive/mugshots/Richard%20Venn%20%5BRik%5D.html">Rik Venn</a> is in the lead with his terrifying Malt Loaf wrapper story from August 2004 in Slovenia.

<b>The "Herman Hertz" Award [For near-death experience while caving]:</b> <a href="/caving/photo_archive/mugshots/Sandeep%20Mavadia.html">Sandeep</a> is racing ahead of the pack currently with multiple nominations including: Not buckling his harness before doing an Alpine SRT cave &amp; his impression of an icicle during the Christmas tour.
