Hello 2016 freshers! Welcome to the Imperial College Caving Club website. If you are interested in caving, you've come to the right place!

A list of our upcoming trips can be found above. There's lots of useful information for new and prospective members [here](/rcc/caving/pages/clubinfo.html) like trip reports: a [typical Wales (fresher's) trip](/rcc/caving/articles/wales-2013-10-25.html) and a [typical Yorkshire trip](/rcc/caving/articles/yorkshire-2014-11-28.html).

You can email us on our [gmail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01pKgPf4L76j23E4ymTAu8fw==&c=CoX_UvK7tWMqLjrzhcaEXTCP8fRKKSw-Cl1eAzdIcj4=) if you have any questions, or you can join our [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/578983745563159/) to get the latest info on trips and socials.

Our next appearance will be in Beit Quad at Fresher's Fair, maybe we will see (or have seen) you there. On Wednesday 5th October we have a talk on our [cave exploration expedition](https://www.facebook.com/events/842837695819494/) at 12pm in Union Meeting Room 4 (all welcome), followed by an equipment familiarisation session (read: climbing in trees with our caving kit) in Princes Gardens at 1 pm (and every Wednesday at 12pm thereafter). Also find us at the Union Bar, every Tuesdays from 7pm for beer and wildly exaggerated tales of past caving adventures - look for a caving helmet to find us!

Here's a video from last year's president, describing the caving club. Fortunately for you, this year's president is far more photogenic.
