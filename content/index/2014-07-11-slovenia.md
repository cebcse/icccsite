The club was on expedition to Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia, from the 11th July to the 17th August. There we joined the local JSPDT to continue exploration of the Tolminski Migovec mountain. Our plan is to setup an underground camp in the Migovec System at Camp X-Ray, and push the deep leads at 800-972 m of depth. The best source of in the field updates will probably be twitter, photos are most likely to appear on facebook as people come down from the mountain / fly home. We have a talk planned for Hidden Earth 2014 in September.
