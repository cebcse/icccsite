An army marches on its stomach, and so too does the expedition. We are naturally limited in our food choice by the need to carry anything we wish to eat up a vertical kilometre and for it to survive 5 weeks (and often significantly longer) without refrigeration (or controllable refrigeration anyway). This means that the menu du jour is principally; pulses, grains, rice, dried vegetables etc.

Despite this limitation we manage to eat enough to survive and often even enjoy the food! Our experimentations in the art of bivi cooking are therefore presented in our bivi cook book, available as a pdf [here](/rcc/caving/FILES/expeditions/slovenia/slov2017/BiviRecipes2017.pdf) . Enjoy!
