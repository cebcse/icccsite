Nine months after I first
went underground with ICCC, I unclipped from the rope at the bottom
of Concorde pitch, deep within the mountain Migovec in western
Slovenia. The white of the floor was breathtaking, polished smooth by
the annual flow of snow melt. I was perhaps the 20<sup>th</sup>
person to stand here &amp; see the colours, the shapes and the sheer
scale of this enormous stone cathedral, every last facet of it formed
by water and gravity.</p>


<p>Connecting me to the world
above, and leading ever deeper, were hundreds of lengths of rope
secured by literally hammering into the rockface – years of
effort by students from ICCC &amp; the Slovenian JSPDT.</p>

<p>I could just see the faint
orange light of my caving buddy 70m above me; I built a cairn of
rocks as a substitute for a tripod, and balanced my old Soviet camera
at an angle I hoped would cover the whole pitch. Dousing my light &amp;
opening the shutter, I shouted 'Rope Free!', replied from a long way
above by a blurred echo of 'OK!'.</p>


<p>Caving has given me some
of the most unique emotions and experiences.</p>
<p>I sat absolutely still (so
as not to to nudge the camera) in the perfect darkness for 15 minutes
and watched the impossibly small orange dot above me float down as
gently as a feather, with the lightning blue flash burning an image
into my retina every minute or two. I don't think I've ever felt
quite so peaceful; quietly biding my time sitting a shelf of rock
surrounded by moonscape.</p>
<p>After packing the camera,
and eating some chocolate; we readied for the ascent – 400m of
rope to climb, nearly five times the height of the Queens Tower. Over
eight hours of solid climbing later, I finally flopped out of the
cave and sniffed at the strange Ozone smell of the vegetation, gazing
up at the star-framed silouttes of the mountains across the valley.
</p>
<p>My buddy, who had been
dilligently waiting at the bottom of pitches as I climbed in case I
struck difficulty (not once grumbling as he read 120 pages of his
paperback sitting in the cold), joined me after a few short minutes.
We stumbled back to the Bivvi following the string as it snaked
around the many hazards on the plateau. I was so utterly exhausted
that I had to be helped out of my caving kit, but was soon warmed by
the fire &amp; refreshed with mugs of hot chocolate and plates of
chilli.</p>
<p>The photo came out; and
with any luck should be reproduced here – a snapshot to
illustrate a snapshot of a single day's experiences while on
expedition with the caving club. There is no way to squeeze the many
activities enjoyed during four weeks in Slovenia into a single
article, but I hope that this tiny sliver may kindle your interest.
</p>
<p>Caving is so much more
than pretty pictures, inky blackness and mud – but is so unique
in experience that it is indescribable, at least with my clumsy
prose!</p>
<p><b>About the Club</b></p>
<p>As enormously taxing as
the sport is – both physically and psychologically, caving is
neither competitive nor macho. The aim is to use people's different
skills in cooperation to further common goals of exploration and
enjoyment. No prior experience is required, all training is done
within the club drawing on the experience of our mature members. All
trips are tailored to the skills and wishes of those taking part &amp;
you will never be asked to do things that you are unhappy with or
that we do not feel your are ready for yet.</p>
<p>Imperial College Caving
Club runs regular weekend trips to caving destinations around the UK
– usually costing £25-30 inclusive of all training,
equipment, transporation, accomodation, food and leadership. As well
as our summer expedition to Slovenia, we have a week long tour in
Easter to somewhere warm and long-weekends to destinations around
Europe in the spring and summer.  
</p>
<p>We meet weekly on Tuesdays
in Southside upper-lounge from 7:30pm; and practice rope-climbing in
the trees in Princes Gardens on Wednesday afternoons from 1pm. Drop
by at some point for a chat &amp; we'll do our best to answer any
questions that you have.</p>

<h1>Expedition Updates</h1>
  <p>
      <b>12<sup>th</sup> August</b><br>
    The expedition is now back in the fleshpots of Tolmin. The cave and bivvy are derigged for another year.
    Party tonight and then the van heads back to Blighty tomorrow. About 1.5 km of new cave this year - mostly
    below -700m, damned impressive in my book. Loads more to do next year though.... <br>
    Yours to the next bottle of Lasko,<br>
    Tetley.

  <p>
    <b>2<sup>nd</sup> August</b><br>
    Ahoy-hoy. Big storm last night.  But another glorious Mig morning.  Lead that might link to sis Mig (Soda stream)
    has been pushed but closed down.  Biggest lead is still north Miles Underground!  300m pushed so far.  Now takes
    2 hours from camp.  Lots of side leads.  Camp is at cactus junction.  Going the other way Double Think apparently
    goes again.  Higher level stuuf remains untouched.  TA and JH will be back from a three nighter today.<br>

    <b>28<sup>th</sup> July</b><br>
    The underground camp is well set up now - eight people have so far camped at the Fridge (although its a nice
    camp - the fridge thermometer does say that its 1°C). We've about four hundred metres of new
    survey data so far. No connection yet - you'll have to wait for the next e-mail. Alls good and pretty much
    the same as ever - popcorn, fire, the bivvy's a mess but you know where stuff is, weather pretty good,
    lots of laughs, talk of particle physics and the latest shit. <br>
    Tetley.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>19<sup>th</sup> July</b><br>
  The van's made it to Tolmin (and is currently trying to make it to Ravne with half the gear).
  The advance party (Tetley and Chris) have already set up the bivvy, collecting snow from
   the huge iceberg that we conveniently found there before heading down to join 20,000 people
  at the Reggae festival in Tolmin. Weather good at the Soca - clouds look ominous over Mig!
  The rigging starts tomorrow... <br>
Yours to the next crate of Lasko, Tetley.
</p>

    <b>17<sup>th</sup> July</b> - Chris Rogers, Tolmin, via txt:<br>
    "Ey oh... Bivvy set up, no water yet. Mountain is gorgeous. Down the hill
    tonight for pizza and reggae. Will see you monday. Chris and Tetley"
</p>

    <b>13<sup>th</sup> July</b> - News from Andrej<br>
    On Monday 12<sup>th</sup> July at 15.04, there was an earth quake in Bovec 4,9
    grade strong. So on Migovec will be all kind of expectations. It is very cold
    and a lot of rain. On Sunday it was 12° in the morning. On Vrsic pass (1600 m)
    there was 10 cm of snow.
