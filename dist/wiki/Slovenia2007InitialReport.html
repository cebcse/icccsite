  <p>Absolutely stonking year, very lucky with the weather, lots of
interesting developments. No accidents, no missed call outs and
generally a very smoothly run, pleasant and safe expedition</p>
<p>Gardeners' World, Captain Kangaroo, pushed to within 28m of the lower M2
1980s JSPDT survey. There is a possibility that we are unknowingly
connected (Slovs did not use PSSs in the 1970s except for a red paint
splodge at the bottom of Silos), and a probability that a connection
exists. This will be a major target for 2008, with the possibility
mooted of rigging down M2.</p>
<p>Combined these would now be 11493m + 5229m = 16722m = 2nd longest in
Slovenia</p>
<h3>Plop Goes!</h3>
<p>Andy and Rik pushed Plop (the tight squeeze) onto the magnificent
Plopzilla pitch. A field of helictites festoon the pitch down onto an
enormous boulder pile. One side of this chamber is unpushed, the other
leads to a boulder choke, as yet unpushed. Plopzilla is 105m deep,
penetrating from NCB to below Exhibition road. This makes it the second
largest pitch in the system after Silos.</p>
<h3>M1 &amp; M6</h3>
<p>Repushed + resurveyed. Still a lead (may need chemical persuasion) in a
window off M1. Small extensions found in M6 - very pretty little bit of
stream formed new cave, ended in draughting bedding plane dig.</p>
<h3>New caves on western edge of plateau</h3>
<p>"Planika" (named after the Edelweiss present on the wester plateau)and
"Monatip", found below B9/M21 (on the western edge of the plateau,
approx 100m north of Primadona) and the initial pushing trips conducted.</p>
<p><strong>Planika:</strong> 166m long, 46m deep <strong>Monatip:</strong> 196m long, 28m deep</p>
<p><strong>Planika</strong> is a high entrance (1801m) which leads directly to a 40m
pitch to a snow plug. Climbing the snow gains another chamber with a
large entrance, and a rift leading off. A very tight pitch head at the
end of rift leads to a 5m pitch which reconnects to a 20m long snow
slope. Digging at the bottom of this snow slope gained another snow
filled chamber, with 'phreatic' esque passage etched through the snow by
the draught, and extremely drippy snow which I believe is certainly
feeding a faithful stream, possibly the one that was found on Smer0 in
Primadona, 200m below. To get to Planika, one must conduct a 30m abseil
down a cliff, then traverse along the ledge. Extremely pretty - one gets
a view across the whole of the Tolminka by day, or the lights of Italy
all the way to Venice by night.</p>
<p><strong>Monatip</strong> is directly below Planika (24m between bottom of snow plug
and early passage), and has a very NCB-like character - possibly a dried
river bed. It undulates along, heading into blank mountain</p>
<h3>U-Bend connected to Primadona</h3>
<p>Hard pushing by Sandeep and Alvin through the previously blown Enigma
squeeze on the 40m U-bend pitch has led to a connection with the Druigi
entrance to Primadona, gaining Prima an additional 57m of height, making
a cave 644m deep. Beautiful survey accuracy - have a look on the .3d
file!</p>
<h3>Razor cave survey</h3>
<p>Coordinated by Martin, we've started to survey Razor cave. 250m already
in the book, its a very interesting clearly fault-driven cave, with easy
access from the Razor hut.</p>
<h3>Primadona Smer0 pitch</h3>
<p>Initial rigging of the Smer0 pitch discovered in October 2006 was
undertaken, bolting down to ~-40m. Pitch is ongoing. Stream was
followed upstream to a tight labyrinth.</p>
<h3>Smashed Swede</h3>
<p>Stefan's climb was bolt-traversed to by Rik + Paul, gaining a window
that would appear to reconnect to Hardy Pitch. A second look wouldn't go
amiss.</p>
<h3>East Pole</h3>
<p>Further work was undertaken in East Pole: a number of promising new
holes were investigated, including E1 - at ~25m deep pitch leading to
too-tight windows that require opening up.</p>
<h3>Stag Cave</h3>
<p>A cave was found within 20m of the tents! A short pitch, rigged on
naturals, lead to a spacious chamber that was unfortunately dead.
However the presence of a large collection of bones (some crushed, but
many in very good condition) that appears to have been from a stag made
up for the disappointment!</p>
<h3>Moth Cave</h3>
<p>Heroic effort was expended in the Moth Cave dig: two extra chambers were
gained, but unfortunately only lead to yet another too-tight squeeze
requiring rock removal. Declared dead and derigged.</p>
<h3>Hawk Cave</h3>
<p>New (safe) method of gaining the cave was constructed by bolting an
abseil from the cliff-head. Most leads off chamber were found to die, a
bolt traverse was made across the pitch to find an aven where we hoped a
parallel shaft may lie. Still to be revisited :- we ran out of time and
rope, and so derigged.</p>
<p>Most of all, this expedition was an enormous training mission: we now
have an extremely strong expedition team together once more, with great
ties to the new JSPDT members.</p>
<p>I think that all the lags can feel extremely proud of the enormous
cannon of information that has been passed on, the new members proud of
the steep learning curve that they all conquered, and everyone proud of
the Caves, little and big, deep and shallow that we've found this year.</p>
<p>Bring on 2008!</p>

<h1>Migovec 2007 – Log Book Write Ups</h1>
<h2>Ping Pong Ball Bombe</h2>
<p>A Slovene super-action was in the making, the shepherd's huts stocked
with drink and the young JSPDT bouncing down to -200m in Prima Dona to
improve the rigging. The plan was to (mainly) investigate leads off
Smer0/Smer1 in Primadona where on a JSPDT trip in Autumn 2006 (joined by
Tetley &amp; Jarv from IC) a large rift with an approx 40m pitch was found -
most tellingly, with water visible at the bottom. Finding a constant
stream this shallow in Mig was unheard of. Meanwhile, a smaller team
would head to Bikini Carwash at the end of Exhibition Road in the main
system and aid climb to see if the passage continued.</p>
<p>The more curious aspect of this mission was the Ping Pong Ball Bombe, a
plan to take ping pong balls down Primadona &amp; set fire to them. The
noxious smell hopefully providing a connection. Alas, the SysMig team
that was to detect with their noses, also contained the most hardened
smokers who spent their time sniffing the air in between dragging on
filterless roll ups!</p>
<p>With mammoth organisation, Rik and I were dispatched down via text
message from the Bivi to Kal, meeting the Slovs and stealing some bread
before crabbing across sideways to Prima. The boulder slope climb was
awful as ever, but I took the opportunity to build a cairn on the edge
of the cliff so that we could recognise this point from the plateau - to
help unravel the mystery of the caves below B9 spotted by Jana &amp; I from
the plateau the Autumn before.</p>
<p>So we went down in a mammoth party: Rik, Jarv, Eric, Aliosha, Izzy,
Silan, Zdenko &amp; Emil</p>
<p>Zdenko led off with the young JSPDT. Emil was a new character to us -
with a bald head framed by round lensed glasses and a fine handlebar
moustache that dovetailed with his military demeanour, were it not for
the Slovene language I could have easily assumed him to be an old-school
English army Colonel. Bringing up the rear with Emil, we were slowed by
his enormous tackle sac, stuffed full of bread and cheese I could only
assume. About 150m in, standing on a traverse line above a pitch, I was
handed a full mineral water bottle from the depths of this magic sack.
"What is it?" I asked. "Mmm... made with fruits... and a kilo of Med
(honey)... its dobra!". Ah, I thought, some marvellous mountain tea
fortified with a shed load of honey - just perfect to give an energy
boost and fight off the dehydration. I chugged it back. Tea it was not.
Double distilled Zjganja with a kilo of honey dissolved in it it was.</p>
<p>Once at the pushing front we found we were rather limited with gear -
just one bolt kit. Rik set to work with Izzy to get down the pitch.
Zdenko and the Eric/Aliosha brotherhood set off for the end of Smer0
(passed where Smer1 reconnected to it) to look at the climb that
currently ended the passage. Jana, Emil &amp; myself traversed over the
pitch (which was a truly frightening undertaking - walls over a metre
apart with a 40m drop down) and went to look at where the water which
trickled down the opposite side came from. From the pools of water we
found a 2m climb into an old dry silted phreatic system leading left
facing towards the end of Smer0, starting just before where Smer1
dropped down. This branched to a small chamber with avens, a too tight
rift (from which, insanely enough, emanated sounds of Rik bolting) and a
chamber with a larger, aid climbable, aven. Alas, with no spare rigging
gear for the climb, and no survey instruments, there wasn't much more
for us to do but go back to Rik.</p>
<p>Rik &amp; co had made it down about 20m to a ledge where he put in a rebelay
bolt. He reckoned he could see the floor a further 20m from there. He
was rather put off by the avalanche of rocks that came down when people
went over the crazy free traverse. The team that went to the end of
Smer0 was already back, and getting cold waiting around with nothing to
do we set off out in small groups. Rik finished the rebelay bolt and
headed back up, as the guys he was with were getting cold.</p>
<p>In the end we didn't burn the Ping Pong Bombes, as Prima appeared to be
breathing 'out' in all the bits a draught was detectable.</p>
<p>As well as the spirits, Emil had another mineral water bottle filled
with white wine, for the journey out. When he returned to the mountain
hut well gone midnight he did not look particularly well. One can only
assume he burnt through his hangover on the pitches out!</p>
<p>Primadona is I'm sure an absolutely amazing cave system, who's secrets
have only been very partially unlocked. Unfortunately I fear it will
require a heroic effort to make easier access (possibly by reactivating
the abseil route, or finding a better abseil way down via
B9/Planika/Monatip) to allow the dozens of small trips necessary to
properly relearn the cave system, recapturing the knowledge lost with
the retirement from caving of the 'middle-aged' JSPDT who mainly
explored Primadona.</p>
<h2>B9 &amp; Beyond!</h2>
<p>Walking briefly over to B9 the day after the super-action, Jana and I
could spot the cairn I left on the headland north of Primadona. Combined
with one built by Jana &amp; I on the headland near U-Bend, suddenly the
whole complicated 3D structure fell into place. Neither of the caves we
could see from the plateau near B9 were Primadona, though the entrances
looked similar - both were new caves in an area never visited!</p>
<p>The next day we were joined on the plateau by some of the young JSPDT.
Jana &amp; I went with Alijosha and Spela to B9, and explained the
situation. The weather was awful - thick cloud everywhere. While the
Slovs re-explored bits of B9 and checked to see if anything had changed
after the earthquake (a pitch had disappeared off the original survey as
a bit of the cave collapsed and turned into a boulder climb!), I placed
two bolts for the descent down the cliff. This was really quite
exhillerating - a gale swept over the edge of the plateau, the rock was
soaked and slippery, and every now and then the clouds would part for a
giddying glimpse of Krn or the Tolminka valley a very long way away!</p>
<p>The next day Aliosja and Spela went down from the plateau, so Jana and I
went back alone to B9 to rig down the cliff. The weather was much
improved. Jana abseiled down first on 'super' low-stretch rope and went
investigating the three cave entrances, while I came down behind and put
in the rebelay bolts. The three entrances were very interesting - the
main one contained an enormous aven which connected back up to the
headland above u-bend (you could see the sky through the top), but was
an enormously steep boulder slope with useless fractured rock for walls.
The further entrance was a crawl in boulders that was only briefly
pushed by Jana. The smallest, highest entrance was the most immediately
interesting - a perfect metre by metre triangular arch which led
directly to a deep pitch. A shimmer of white was just visible at the
bottom. Bolts were placed for a traverse along a beautiful slab of
limestone to save freeclimbing on the steep bowl valley edged with a
cliff, and the main hang bolt + first rebelay was placed for the
small-cave pitch, finishing our 100m rope. We decided to name this new
cave 'Planika Jama', after the rare mountain flower growing from a crack
in the limestone pavement used as a traverse ledge.</p>
<p>Rather confusingly, we could occasionally hear echo-y shouts bouncing
around from below as we walked about the bowl valley, inevitably
disturbing stones which tumbled down. Initially we thought the voices
were walkers on the footpath a very long way below. We tried to be as
careful as we could, but couldn't really understand what was going on -
except for the fact that one of the voices sounded like Kos.</p>
<p>Once back on the plateau, Jana pieced together the situation by mobile -
Alijosha and Spela had gone down to Kal, and found away to the lower
cave entrance pointed out to them the day before. They found a route via
an abseil down the headland near Primadona where I had placed the cairn,
ending up in the perched valley one below Planika. Jana went down to Kal
to discuss the situation that evening, coming back up the next day. The
lower cave was to be called Monatip ('Fucking Idiot' in the local
dialect).</p>
<p>The next day started with Goaty &amp; Jarv surface surveying to B9. Jana and
I then descended the cliff, surveying as we went. Again, within the
cave, we used the efficient technique of the lightweight Jana abseiling
down past rub-points, followed by Jarv bolting the rebelays behind while
Jana explored the next bit. The pitch was perhaps the most beautiful
entrance pitch on the Mig plateau. From a bolt placed in the sloping
ceiling a hang dropped down past a fridge-sized boulder before swinging
out to a rebelay or an enormous flake (placed by using my walking boot
heel 'skyhook'). From here one abseiled down an almost perfect brick
wall, above an enormous snow plug, before swinging into a little dry
streamway cascade to pass the last bolt and land on the snow plug. The
snow contained a large metre wide 6m deep hole bored out of the ice by
wind or water, and similar, more narrow, gaps on the edges of the plug.
A small rift led off SW but immediately closed down. The cascade was
gained by swinging, and seemed to be made out of narrow inlets at the
top.</p>
<p>From the top-left of the snow plug Jana found a crawl way under a rock
bridge to a climb up on ice on one side and rock on the other (the ice
was a more reliable foothold!), to reach a snow-filled chamber which was
daylight flooded and clearly below the slope of the large entrance. We
named this chamber Yorkshire Pudding, as was filled with a torus of
dimpled-centre snow. From the far side of the chamber (after an icy
traverse) one could squeeze down between the rock and snow, attempt a
climb past a stack of wedged boulders towards the aven, or walk down a
snow-bottomed meander (one could also squeeze down the side between snow
and rock). The meander we named 'Acre Lane' after our London home. This
meander suddenly regained a rock floor and led on to a tight rift which
seemed to be a small pitch head. There were a lot of boulders strewn
around. Here we PSS'ed and headed back.</p>
<p>The next day we were joined by Andreja &amp; James H. Jana and Andreja
bolted the backup bolt for this new traverse, while I gardened my way
along the tight rift and then placed a bolt holding myself in place
within the rift by breathing in until my ribs were wedged securely! This
was perhaps the slowest bolt I've every placed as I was lying sideways
with the arm holding the driver bent back behind my head, and the hammer
cocked under my budy, while considering the 6m drop to the floor. It was
with some relief that I took the rope through from the girls and
rebelayed my way down.</p>
<p>Around the corner the cave got strange once more - from a rock balcony
one is confronted with a chamber filled with a 45 degree slope of
compacted snow. Exploring around this we found that the upper levels
shut down, but seemed diggable (from the survey it appears that we were
within a metre of the Yorkshire Pud - it must be the same snow slope),
and there was a beautiful inlet which had formed some amazing
ice-pearls. The obvious way on was down. The snow steepened and
disappeared down at about 60 degrees with the rock roof not too far
away. Careful traversing across the snow, I placed a bolt on the wall,
and abseiled down on my back. The ceiling closed in and the rope began
to rub, the walls shut down from both sides. At the bottom I faced the
end of the snow, with a 50cm gap of boulders sitting there.</p>
<p>The next step was obvious as it was insane - digging at the bottom of a
funnel with a lot of loose rubbish above. By picking up the boulders and
rotating I found I could play an effective game of Tetris, the fitting
pieces disappearing with a gravely rush through the floor. There was a
strong draft, what on earth was I digging towards? Images of digging
directly onto a pitch floated in front of my eyes!</p>
<p>There was an utterly terrifying series of rock booms and human shouts
almost directly above my head. I pushed myself into the corner of the
snow shoot and hoped for the best. It turned out that the rift pitch
head had been disrupted as someone passed rope through, collapsing a
drystone wall and sending a few hundred kilos of rocks cascading down,
none of which luckily found their way onto the snow slope. Jana had just
reached the rebelay bolt going up, narrowly avoiding being caught in the
waterfall of limestone.</p>
<p>Once I stopped hyperventilating, and accepted that no further boulders
were coming down, I carried on digging with bare (now bloodied) hands.
With ten minutes of frantic energy, a way was found. Originally I was
digging alongside the snow, but as it opened up I found I could go
straight down and away. A 5m climb on boulders took me down to the
strangest chamber I have ever been in.</p>
<p>Still attached to the rope, I stood on a metre wide ledge that ran
alongside a wall of perfect white ice. The ice was wet - drips were
everywhere. The ledge continued and narrowed, snaking alongside this
berg. From the middle of the ledge I saw the strangest sight of my life</p>
<ul>
<li>a phreatic crawlway winding down at 45 degrees through the ice,
distinctly blowing, and with a similar rock ledge and wall visible on
the other side. With no bolt kit and no camera, I headed out to my
shaken compatriots. I was frozen, as my wellies and cuffs were now
packed with snow, and everyone was a little spooked after the collapse.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our last trip was a speedy survey, photo and derig, with Ben B and Emil.
Jana went down the ice slope but didn't fancy the still unstable boulder
climb, so we surveyed from this edge. The photo-gear was too much of an
effort to get passed the tight rift-pitch. Ben placed his first bolt as
a safety for the traverse across the ice. After surveying back to above
the rift pitch, we switched to photography documenting the cave as we
derigged out with the rope and metalwork.</p>
<p>Emil and Ben headed back to the Bivi while Jana &amp; I met to Tetley to
bolt down with the Planika rope to reach Monatip. This was so Izzy &amp; him
could surface and cave survey the following day, tying monatip in via
both Primadona (which was surface surveyed down from u-bend by abseil)
and Planika. Glorious weather, we sat watching the sun set behind Krn,
with the Venetian bay visible beyond.</p>

<h2>Rik and Andy go to Plop</h2>
<h2>(an abject Failure)</h2>
<p>The mission was simple – venture into Sys Mig, traverse the gaping holes
on Level 2 to reach the ratty old rope for Faulty Towers and push into
NCB. Once there we hoped to bottom the fabled 'Plop', a big pitch just
off NCB, rumoured to be over 50m, strongly draughting and utterly
jinxed!</p>
<p>Armed only with a vague description from a rather drunken Tetley the
night before, we set off for M16 during a brief lull in the raging
storm. Once down in the cave we quickly hopped up to NCB, reviewing the
excellent tourist trip across the big stuff in the system.</p>
<p>When we got to NCB, we stumbled as Tetley had not mentioned the lairy
traverse over a ~20m drop on tatty 13-year-old 9mm. We concluded that
Plop was the pitch immediately below the rope from Torn T. This was the
error which cost us the pitch. The bolts continued down the pitch and I
had a sinking feeling as I reached the bottom of this pointless lead.</p>
<p>After this we inspected the rest of NCB going East, crossing the bad
traverse with some care. Andy and I took it in turns to examine the side
passages and one of the ones I inspected was, as in the legend of '95, a
very windy squeeze, which could be depth tested by throwing rocks with
some difficulty. I was sure this was it, but Andy had an earlier memory
which led us to think that it might be Godzilla. Stones took around
three or four seconds to drop!</p>
<p>We left with five hours to spare before callout, on the very cautious
side, and left the tackle bags at NCB. Tomorrow we're going back, and
this time Plop must be conquered!</p>

<h2>The Eventful Conquest of Plopzilla (nee. Plop)</h2>
<p>After my first trip to NCB I was kept awake thinking about that three to
four second drop known simply as 'Plop'. By eleven the next morning I'd
managed to convince Andy of the merit of a return visit. Since we'd left
the necessary tools and rope for bolting a monster pitch in NCB, we
quickly shot down the M16 entrance series and up Faulty Towers into NCB.</p>
<p>Fairly terrified of getting stuck in the tight pitch head above that
formidable drop, I took off most of my SRT kit, leaving just cows-tails
and Croll. The squeeze was fairly easy and Andy passed through the bags
as I put in a bolt to make a Y-hang.</p>
<p>Since Plop had already been attempted several times there were quite a
few existing bolts. I made use of these on the way, stopping only to
take down a couple of boost bars: a bit of Cadbury Courage. I felt oddly
calm swinging about in the huge chamber. We had thrown more rocks from
the top but the bottom was too far away to see. Even from the first
rebelay I was having trouble speaking to Andy. Our words boomed around
the huge pitch. Two rebelays down, I was standing on a gravel floor,
shivering with the adrenaline. I'd been forced to put in a knot pass in
the rope and reverse prussic past it. Two more bolts got us to the
bottom of the pitch, by which point our nerves were totally shredded.
Though the hang of the rope was very clean, a rope disappearing into
empty blackness above can be really terrifying!</p>
<p>Though we were almost expecting to break into 'Level 3', an as-yet
undiscovered horizontal passage at least three kilometres long, the
pitch was completed choked with boulders at its lowest point. We scoured
the nooks and crannies before pronouncing the bottom of Plop officially
dead.</p>
<p>However, twenty metres back up the gravel slope, another boulder choke
went down, an obvious lead for a return visit but by this stage we were
too tired to push and survey a new cave passage. We left a going lead in
boulders, along with an easy swing into a window halfway down the pitch.</p>
<p>Exit from the cave was difficult due to being tired and thirsty but we
were in a jubilant mood after a seventy-six metre survey leg! Plop was
the biggest pitch either of us had ever seen. As the first to bottom
this monster, we renamed it 'Plopzilla'.</p>
<p>Analysing the survey data back at the bivi, it measured in at an
impressive 105m of depth.</p>

<h2>Riggin' Captain Kangaroo</h2>
<p>First trip was with Thara. Tet had already rigged down Pico (re-bolting
it in the process), so we set off for that familiar window with a
bolting hammer, a hundred metres of rope and a couple of cinnamon malt
loaves. Had the same trouble finding Tet's single bolt as I'd had in</p>
<ol>
<li>However, instead of bottling it, I placed two new spitz, this time
within sensible reach for easy rigging. A hundred metres of rope got us
to Traverse Chamber, cursing and kicking the heavy bag all the way
through Scrotty.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sandeep was the next victim, this time we set off with a hundred and
fifty metres of rope. We rigged down to Olympic Rift, stopping on the
way to chisel open an awkward squeeze. We left thirty metres of rope in
a tacklesac at the start of Olympic Rift and did some re-bolting on the
last two pitches. Also left three hangers and maillons, ten spits &amp;
cones, two karabiners, a chisel and two slings. At this stage the
squeeze and huge black space the other side at the end of Olympic rift
seemed like the best lead in Captain Kangaroo.</p>
<p>A bounce to Pico with James gave me the chance to do some more work on
the entrance to Captain Kangaroo. I put in a tensioned traverse which
removed the 'traditional' rub-point at the start of the take off.</p>
<p>Richard Venn</p>
<h2>Pushin' Captain Kangaroo in 2007</h2>
<p>I had hoped that keen cavers would rush into Captain Kangaroo to push
the more shallow lead off Traverse Chamber, leaving me to go and smash
open Olympic Rift to fame and great glory in whatever gaping chasm lay
beyond the terminal squeeze. Unfortunately, Vom-Brown and the Deep
turned back near Bonus Chamber, with 'visions of hell' muttered back at
the bivvi from the first sign of mild scrotty-ness.</p>
<p>I collared young Ben in the bivvi over a generous swig or two of
rum-spiked tea and we hatched a plan to crawl along a tight rift that
I'd looked down with Jarv in 2005, but been unable to survey due to lack
of tape. With survey pencils and instruments in tow, we slipped through
the cave to the pushing front and stripped off SRT kits to pass more
easily through the rift. This was somewhat tighter than I'd remembered
and shredded my PVC oversuit.</p>
<p>We pushed as far as we dared survey, breaking out right at end into a
large double chamber with several leads coming off. The most obvious of
these was a climb down into what looked like walking passage.</p>
<p>Returning a few days later with Izzy from Tolmin, with a bag of rope and
bolting kit, we pushed the passage another fifty metres or so. Some
gardening of large rocks was required to pass a short section of rift
but we were mostly in big passage, clambering down rather sharply over a
series of climbs.</p>
<p>Eventually we reached a point where a big passage closed up to about one
or two metres of very tight rift with a big (approx. two second) drop on
the other side. This was passable but looked more than a little
unpleasant without some serious work with a chisel.</p>
<p>We looked around the chamber a little more before discovering a tight
sharp crawl which dog-legged before coming out in beautiful white rock
at the top of a twenty metre pitch. Izzy belayed my full weight from
within the crawl while I put in the two bolts. This allowed us to
descend to the bottom of the pitch with a few metres of rope to spare.
This is possibly not the same pitch we were throwing rocks down through
the tight rift but obviously very close!</p>
<p>As we dropped the pitch there were windows on both sides looking like
they came from either other pitches or more rift-like development as
well as two leads at the bottom. These were a small Captain
Kangaroo-esque rift and ten or twenty metres more of the pitch. We left
~10m of rope, but took the tacklesac out.</p>
<p>This was a very exciting new section of passage. We named the contents
of our push “Kill 'em All” after the first Metallica album. Upon
inspection of our survey data, it became clear that we were exceedingly
close to passage below Silos/Godzilla in M2 (less than thirty metres at
closest approach).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a month on Migovec was starting to catch up with me and
though I wanted another trip in Gardeners' World to push Olympic rift, I
was completely exhausted with very sore knees. The leads we left in
Kangaroo this year will be far too tantalising to sideline in favour of
surface work in 2008. The prospect of a connection with the System seems
very likely and next year we're already planning a return to M2 to
resurvey (our current data comes from a 1970s survey carried out with a
home-built clinometer!) and to exhaust the deep leads.</p>

<h1>Alex Pitcher Memorial Award Report</h1>
<p><em>by Ben Banfield</em></p>
<p>This summer I was a member of Imperial College Caving Club's expedition
to Tolminski Migovec in the Julian Alps in Slovenia. The club has been
running the expedition for over a decade now and was looking forward to
improving my caving skills and techniques as well as contributing to the
knowledge about the caves under the Migovec plateau. The Alex Pitcher
Memorial Fund kindly awarded me some money which helped me purchased my
own helmet and helmet mounted light. Having my own helmet mounted light
was essential to my participation in the expedition, as the club only
owns FX3's with batteries on a belt that are unsuitable for Migovec due
to the batteries needing a mains. Below is a report of most of my caving
activities during the expedition.</p>
<h3>Wednesday 18th: (July)</h3>
<p>After being suggested as a lead with a lot of potential and a good place
for budding cave explorers, Tom Brown and myself set off for Moth Cave,
in shorts, t-shirts, knee-pads and helmets for a look. Spent a few hours
shifting boulders and scree 15m into the cave at the pushing front,
before leaving. Has a gusting draught at the pushing front. Will return
again with tools and proper clothing for a better look.</p>
<h3>Thursday 19th:</h3>
<p>Alvin joined Tom and myself today to continue pushing the lead in Moth
Cave. After a few rotations of digging we had a badger sized hole and
decided to stop for lunch. Afterwards more excavating around the badger
hole and scree slope occurred. Several animal bones were recovered from
the scree. An ominous slab of rock sat at the top of the scree making
progress tenuous. Further digging around the badger hole led to another
badger sized tunnel off to the left of the original. After moving 45-50
bags of scree we called it a day. Out 8pm with plans to ask about
explosives for further pushing.</p>
<h3>Friday 20th:</h3>
<p>A short look at Moth with t-shirts and shorts again with Martin to ask
about explosives and other digging options. Moved the ominous boulder at
the top of the scree to ease our minds about becoming crushed. The
bottom of the scree slope was dug to more resemble a trench for easier
access to the pushing front.</p>
<h3>Sunday 22nd:</h3>
<p>With the potential for leads and the fact that Moth lies on top of the
System Migovec / Primadona connection area linking it into the main
survey was a priority. Martin taught several of us the essentials of
surveying while we surface surveyed to Moth entrance. Alvin and Thara
continued digging while Martin, Tom and myself surveyed to the pushing
front. 6 survey stations later we joined up with the digging team. Using
various combinations of left and right-handers we made a lot of progress
expanding the left hand badger hole and the trench. Breakthrough looking
likely tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Tuesday 24th:</h3>
<p>After a day's break I rejoined the Moth pushing team. Sandeep had joined
us and almost straight away he managed to squeeze through the tunnel
(now named Badger Highway) and into a small chamber. Alvin and myself
then made it through and throughout the afternoon work commenced on
enlarging Badger Highway from the other end, to make it accessible to
larger cavers. The chamber contained going leads. One, a long
crawl/squeeze that needed enlarging had most potential.</p>
<h3>In 3rd week of expedition:</h3>
<p>After proving to be such a promising lead before the expedition and
during the first two weeks, Moth cave needed the final push to see
whether it goes or dies. The day prior the petrol drill joined us to try
and enlarge Badger Highway to allow more people to reach the pushing
front. Unfortunately the drill was more of a hindrance than a help,
fuming the cave and not expanding the passage.</p>
<p>With no draught coming from the pushing front or even through Badger
Highway any more, hopes for a breakthrough didn't look promising.
Everyone else had plans for the next day, so armed with a survey kit and
some bright red nail varnish, I took on the mission of completing the
survey and exploring all available leads.</p>
<p>The squeeze through the tunnel looked more daunting than ever, but with
the knowledge a call-out team would be along within a few hours, I
pushed through. Minor digging allowed me further access along the main
lead. Another small chamber with no going leads was found. The nail
varnish came in useful to mark a permanent survey station. Taking all
digging tools and the survey notes out, I was back to camp well before
my call-out and in time for a nice rest in the sun.</p>
<p>After a jolly into System Migovec earlier in the week in a large group,
it was definitely time for me to go deep in a pair. What better way than
to help Rik push Captain Kangaroo! With leads that had been looked at
but not surveyed, interesting data collection in scrott was the order of
the day. Down, down, down through the early Gardeners' World pitches and
past some “interesting” rigging (greatly improved later in the
expedition). Squiggling through the rifts in Scrotty until we reached
Traverse Chamber. The first lead ended quickly in a pitch preceded by a
tight squeeze past a spiney. With no rope and no hammer to help make the
entrance more accessible let alone rigging, it was impossible for now.
After surveying back to a fork, we pushed on.</p>
<p>What followed was a crash course in free climbing as taught by Rik.
Plenty of top tips later, we made it past the fiddly squeeze where Rik
and Jarvist turned back at the last exploration. Beyond was an open
chamber. Rik climbed down and suddenly Captain Kangaroo became a whole
lot more exciting. A pitch, two going rifts and horizontal walking
passage. The climb was do-able, but really needed rigging, so we turned
and surveyed back to Traverse Chamber. Out an hour early, we hurried
back to camp for slop. As our survey data, excitement mounted. Our data
was heading towards System Migovec for the mythical connection. The
laptop was whipped out and data entered. Our survey came within 36m of
the bottom M2 below Silos! A bit of rope and some further pushing and
we'll be there . Roll on the survey legs!</p>
<p>I found the expedition an extremely enjoyable and fulfilling experience.
I gained a lot of valuable caving experience. The exploration and
discovery of new cave passage was very rewarding. Having my waist freed
from wearing a battery belt, made caving in tight passageway and
squeezes immeasurably easier. I would like to thank the Ghar Parau
Foundation and the Alex Pitcher Memorial Fund for helping me on my first
caving expedition.</p>
